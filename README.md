# Project Overview
The project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** on Airbnb's Listings and Reviews datasets for five major Tech Hubs in the United States: **Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas and San Francisco**. Key tasks include descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, price trends, neighborhood comparisons, outlier detection, and review text analysis.

# Data Source
Data is sourced from Inside Airbnb. The datasets used are:
- **Detailed Lisitings Dataset**: This dataset contains contains detailed information about each property, such as the `location`, `neighbourhood`, `price`, `minimum_nights`, `maximum_nights`, `availability`, `features` etc.
- **Detailed Reviews Dataset**: This dataset includes guest comments on various properties, reflecting their experiences and attributes such as the `listing_id` and `review_comments` .

# Objectives:
1. Perform EDA on Listings data (e.g., price, review scores).
2. Engineer features from Reviews data to predict guest satisfaction.
3. Identify correlations and trends across neighborhoods using the listings data.

# Tasks
* Descriptive Statistics: Summary stats for key features like price and review scores.
* Distribution Analysis: Visualize distributions and detect outliers.
* Correlation & Price Analysis: Identify correlations and trends in pricing across neighborhoods.
* Review Feature Engineering: Extract keywords and analyze review text length.
