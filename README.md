# Project Overview
The project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** on Airbnb's Listings and Reviews datasets for five major Tech Hubs in the United States: **Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas and San Francisco**. Key tasks include descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, price trends, neighborhood comparisons, outlier detection, and review text analysis.

# Data Source
Data is sourced from Inside Airbnb. The datasets used are:
- **Detailed Lisitings Dataset**: This dataset contains contains detailed information about each property, such as the `location`, `neighbourhood`, `price`, `minimum_nights`, `maximum_nights`, `availability`, `features` etc.
- **Detailed Reviews Dataset**: This dataset includes guest comments on various properties, reflecting their experiences and attributes such as the `listing_id` and `review_comments` .

# Objectives:
1. Perform EDA on Listings data (e.g., price, review scores).
2. Engineer features from Reviews data to predict guest satisfaction.
3. Identify correlations and trends across neighborhoods using the listings data.

# Tasks
* **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate summary statistics for numerical features such as `price`, `minimum_nights`, `maximum_nights`, `number_of_reviews`, and
`review_scores_rating`. Understand the central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of these variables.
* **Distribution Analysis**: Plot histograms or density plots for key numerical features like `price`, `minimum_nights`, and `review_scores_rating`. Analyze the
distribution of these features to identify any skewness or outliers.
* **Correlation Analysis**: Create a correlation matrix to explore relationships between numerical variables such as `price`, `number_of_reviews`, `availability_365`,
and `review_scores_rating`. Identify any strong correlations that might be useful for predictive modeling or further investigation.
* **Price Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of prices across different neighborhoods (`host_neighbourhood`) or room types (if available). Understand which
neighborhoods have higher or lower average prices and whether certain neighborhoods are more popular for shortterm or longterm stays.
* **Neighborhood Comparison**: Compare the average `review_scores_rating` across different neighborhoods. Determine if certain neighborhoods have consistently higher
ratings, which could indicate better or worse guest experiences.
* **Outlier Detection**: Identify outliers in the dataset, particularly in `price`, `minimum_nights`, and `review_scores_rating`.
* **Text Length**: Create a new feature that measures the length of each review (number of words or characters). Determine if the length of a review
correlates with its sentiment or the review scores.
* **Keyword Extraction**: Identify and count the occurrence of specific keywords (e.g., "clean," "comfortable," "noisy") in the reviews. Generate new features based on the
presence of these keywords, which might influence guest satisfaction.

# Limitations
* **Correlation Analysis**: Handling of NaN values: We dropped the NaN values from the dataset assuming there is no significant difference in the data analysis. 
* **Price Analysis**:
1- **Data Skewness**: Pricey homes can totally mess up the average prices. The median's probably better for seeing what homes in a neighborhood actually go for. 
2- **Missing Key Variables**: The analysis skips over stuff like the season, the quality of the property, and amenities‚Äîthings that all affect prices. It also does not look at occupancy rates. 
* **Neighborhood Comparison**:
1 - Missing Data: Some neighborhoods do not have review scores listed and hence were excluded from the analysis, which might result in an incomplete comparison. 
2 - Unequal Distribution: Some neighborhoods could have many listings while others may have fewer. The average rating thus may not accurately reflect guest experiences in neighborhoods with fewer listings. 
3 - Outliers: Since we do not capture extreme values, a few listings with very extreme ratings could influence the overall average of a neighborhood. 
* **Outlier Detection**:
1- Sensitivity of Methods: IQR and Z-score methods could flag legit cases, like luxury homes or long-term rentals, as outliers, especially if the data's a bit skewed. 
2- Over-simplification of Stay Durations: Places designed for longer stays could get wrongly flagged as outliers because of their minimum night stays. 
3- Static Data: The analysis does not consider price changes over time, meaning the outliers it detects might only be temporary. 
* **Text Length**: Blank Reviews: Some listing_id values did not have associated reviews. In the code, we handled this by excluding those rows, assuming their absence would not significantly impact the overall data analysis. Similarly for some listing_id there were no review score associated so we excluded those rows as well. 
* **Keyword Extraction**:
1 - Keyword Limitations: The selected keywords, although common, may not fully capture the entire scope of guest experiences. Additional keywords or specific vocabulary could enhance the analysis. 
2 - Keyword Context: The approach counts keyword occurrences without considering the context. For example, the word ‚Äúclean‚Äù may appear in both positive and negative scenarios (e.g., not clean). More advanced techniques, like NLP, could be used to address this. 
3 - Review Availability: The availability of few or no reviews may not provide meaningful data for analysis, which can lead to incomplete insights for listings.
