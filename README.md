# Project Overview
The project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** on Airbnb's Listings and Reviews datasets for five cities(city1,  city2, city3,city4,city5). Key tasks include descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, price trends, neighborhood comparisons, outlier detection, and review text analysis.

# Objectives:
1. Perform EDA on Listings data (e.g., price, review scores).
2. Engineer features from Reviews data to predict guest satisfaction.
3. Identify correlations and trends across neighborhoods.
